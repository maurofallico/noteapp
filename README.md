The application is a note-taking platform that offers CRUD operations, enabling users to efficiently manage their notes. The application provides an intuitive and appealing user interface, with features including note categorization, archiving, filtering, and an authentication system.

### Key Features:

- **<ins>Create</ins>:** Users can create new notes by providing a title, content, and optional categories.
